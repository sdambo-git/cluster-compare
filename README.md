# cluster-compare Install & Usage
## cluster-compare oc plugin installation
You can use the 4.19 version from available in my repository it was compiled from source code , the reason of compiling the 4.19 is because it has some template creation improvments
pay attention that the file is compiled on rhel9 OS !

And the 4.19 version of the tool isn't released yet...  It's part of 4.19 OpenShift GA :

https://github.com/openshift/kube-compare/blob/release-4.18/docs/image-build.md

you need to clone the cluster compare from github and run it as instructed.
